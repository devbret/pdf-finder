# PDF Finder

PDF Finder sends structured queries through the Google Search API, filters results for PDF documents and saves them locally while maintaining a full record of search results in both JSON and CSV formats. The program automatically handles duplicates, generates clean filenames and includes configurable parameters for pagination, delay and download timeout.

Once configured, running the script will search for PDFs matching your keywords, download them to a local folder and store a manifest of all results for easy tracking and reuse. This makes PDF Finder ideal for academic researchers, data collectors or professionals needing to automate the retrieval of documents from public web sources.
